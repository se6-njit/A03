## Part 1: Directions on Using Webstorm/Git/GitHub

1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students and apply for an account. After clicking the "Apply now" button, apply with "Official document" to complete the application.
2. Once your application is processed (which can take a couple of days), you will be able to proceed and download Webstorm from JetBrains.
3. Get git on your computer. To do this, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and click on the download corresponding to your OS. Then follow the steps.
4. Set up a GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/join and create an account using your NJIT email.
5. Connect Webstorm to Git. Open up Webstorm and in settings > Git, provide the Git executable file if it is not already set.
6. Connect Webstorm to your GitHub account. In Webstorm, open system preferences and provide your GitHub password.
7. Create a Repository. In your GitHub account, navigate to Repositories and create a new one, make sure it is public and with a README.md file.
8. Connect Webstorm to your new Repository. When you open Webstorm, select VCS and paste in the URL for your repository. This will import your GitHub repository as well as provide version control (through git).
9. Congratulations! You have now set up Git, Webstorm, and GitHub.
